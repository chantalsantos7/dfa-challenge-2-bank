# Task 1

## Benefits

The client needs this banking software in order to store the account details of their customers, and help streamline the process of accessing an account for their customers by providing them with an easy to use application. Customers won't be required to go to a bank branch to access their account, as they will be able to effectively manage their finances from their own computer, which is more convenient for them. This software will allow them to clearly see their account details and make transactions such as deposits and withdrawals easily.

Having this capability means that the bank's physical locations will have less clients who only need to do the simple transactions that could be managed by the app, and so they can dedicate more time and resources to people who need more complex financial services like loans and mortgages. This will allow the bank to invest more in developing and improving these services.
